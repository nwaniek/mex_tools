Beware, this is old code and I can't really remember every purpose for
it. However, it may be useful as a starting point. If it works out of
the box, then congratulations! You may spend me a beer ;-)

These functions provide some guidance and help in how to extend matlab
with some specific problems in mind. For instance you may want to pass
an object from your extension to Matlab so that you can use it later in
a different function. To do so, use the functions provided in
mexutil.hpp. If you're more interested in creating arrays of structures,
or how to call function handles in matlab or even how to turn them into
callable C++ objects, look at the other files.

The Makefile is very basic, you should be able to change them to your
setup quickly.
